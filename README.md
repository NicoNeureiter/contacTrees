# contacTrees
A [BEAST 2](http://beast2.org/) package for jointly inferring phylogies and contact events from linguistic data.

## Installation
* Install BEAST 2 (available from [http://beast2.org](http://beast2.org)).
* Add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicoNeureiter/contacTrees/master/package.xml to your package repositories
	* Open BEAUti, select `File => Manage packages` menu. The package manager dialog pops up.
	* Click the `Package Repositories` button. The repositories dialog pops up.
	* Click `Add URL`
	* Enter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicoNeureiter/contacTrees/master/package.xml` in the entry, and click `OK`
	* Click the `Done` button, and contacTrees should appear in the package list.
* Install the contacTrees package through the [package manager](http://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/)

## Using contacTrees
To use contacTrees, create a BEAST2 file that has separate alignments for different concepts (eg. using [BEASTling](https://github.com/lmaurits/BEASTling/) with rate variation or by filling in an existing template using [Lexedata](https://github.com/Anaphory/lexedata)) and add operators, state nodes, and change likelihood elements. A detailed example can be found inside [the examples folder](examples/starting-with-beastling).

## Case study
Scripts and data for reproducing a case study using contacTrees is avaialbe at [github.com/NicoNeureiter/contacTrees-IndoEuropean](https://github.com/NicoNeureiter/contacTrees-IndoEuropean)
